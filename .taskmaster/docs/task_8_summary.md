# Task 8 — Implement TTS Synthesis Client — Summary

Status: ✅ Done

Implementation Date: 2025-10-17

## Goal

Implement a robust, modular TTS (Text-to-Speech) synthesis client with a provider abstraction that exposes `synthesize_speech(text: str) -> bytes`. The client must support multiple output formats, provider health checks, automatic fallback, and integration points for FastAPI and LangGraph agent flows.

## What was implemented

- A modular TTS service under `src/services/tts_service/` with a provider abstraction (a `TTSProvider` ABC).
- A concrete `FishSpeechProvider` implementation that wraps the Fish Speech HTTP client.
- `TTSService`: provider management, selection/failover logic, and health checks.
- `TTSClient`: a public-facing convenience client exposing `synthesize_speech(text: str) -> bytes` and helpers for base64 and file outputs.
- Demo script and examples showing integration patterns and usage.
- Configuration entries added to `src/configs/settings.py` and integration with the main `src/services` package.

## Files created

- `src/services/tts_service/__init__.py` — package exports and public interface
- `src/services/tts_service/service.py` — core TTS service and provider management
- `src/services/tts_service/fish_speech.py` — Fish Speech provider implementation
- `src/services/tts_service/tts_client.py` — public client API
- `examples/tts_synthesis_demo.py` — usage/demo script
- `tests/test_tts_synthesis.py` — comprehensive test suite for the TTS service

## Files modified

- `src/services/__init__.py` — added TTS exports

# Task 8 — Implement TTS Synthesis Client — Summary

**Status:** ✅ Done

**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-17

## Goal

Implement a robust, modular TTS (Text-to-Speech) synthesis client with a provider abstraction that exposes `synthesize_speech(text: str) -> bytes`. The client supports multiple output formats, provider health checks, automatic fallback, and integration points for FastAPI and LangGraph agent flows.

## What was implemented

- A modular TTS service under `src/services/tts_service/` with a `TTSProvider` abstract base class.
- A concrete `FishSpeechProvider` implementation that wraps the Fish Speech HTTP API.
- `TTSService` that manages providers, implements failover/selection logic, and exposes provider health checks.
- `TTSClient`, a simple public API that provides `synthesize_speech(text: str) -> bytes` and helper methods for base64 and file outputs.
- Demo script and examples showing integration patterns (`examples/tts_synthesis_demo.py`).
- Configuration entries in `src/configs/settings.py` and integration with `src/services` package exports.

## Files created

- `src/services/tts_service/__init__.py` — package exports and public interface
- `src/services/tts_service/service.py` — core TTS service and provider management
- `src/services/tts_service/fish_speech.py` — Fish Speech provider implementation
- `src/services/tts_service/tts_client.py` — public client API
- `examples/tts_synthesis_demo.py` — usage/demo script
- `tests/test_tts_synthesis.py` — comprehensive test suite for the TTS service

## Files modified

- `src/services/__init__.py` — added TTS exports
- `src/services/health.py` — now uses internal TTS health checks
- `src/main.py` — TTS initialization added to app lifespan (where applicable)
- `src/configs/settings.py` — added TTS base URL and related settings

## Tests & Results

- 17 tests added in `tests/test_tts_synthesis.py`, covering:
  - `TTSClient` behavior
  - `TTSService` provider management, failover, and health checks
  - `FishSpeechProvider` request/response handling
  - Global helper functions and one end-to-end integration test

**Test status:** ✅ All 17 TTS tests pass (run via `uv run pytest` as part of the full suite)

## Key features delivered

1. `synthesize_speech(text: str) -> bytes` — primary public API
2. Provider abstraction (`TTSProvider`) for extensibility
3. Fish Speech provider integration
4. Automatic provider fallback and selection logic
5. Provider health monitoring (exposed via `/health`)
6. Multiple output formats: raw bytes, base64, file
7. Robust error handling and logging
8. Singleton/global initialization pattern for safe reuse

## Integration & Usage

- Health checks: `src/services/health.py` queries the internal TTS service.
- FastAPI: `TTSClient`/`TTSService` can be initialized in app lifespan and injected via dependencies.
- LangGraph: Ready for agent nodes to synthesize audio responses (Task 10 / Task 14).

Example (quick usage):

```python
from src.services.tts_service import get_tts_service

tts = get_tts_service()
audio_bytes = tts.synthesize_speech("Hello from DesktopMate+")
```

## Demo

Run the included demo script (requires configured Fish Speech API):

```bash
uv run examples/tts_synthesis_demo.py
```

## Code quality

- PEP8 compliant and formatted with `ruff`/`black`.
- Type hints throughout; `mypy` passes in CI (type stubs added/handled where necessary).
- Pre-commit hooks configured and passing.

## Next steps (recommended)

- Add retries/backoff and an optional circuit-breaker for provider calls.
- Add metrics and tracing for observability (latency, errors, counts).
- Provide a local mock provider for faster offline development and CI.
- Consider non-blocking or streaming TTS APIs for long outputs.
- Integrate with Task 10 (LangGraph nodes) and Task 14 (`POST /v1/chat`) for end-to-end voice responses.

## Notes

- Task 8 is complete and production-ready for the scope defined in Task Master.
- The TTS implementation is modular and makes adding new providers straightforward.
